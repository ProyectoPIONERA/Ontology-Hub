                    .aboutDesc The objective of #{app_name_shorcut} is to store Linked Open Vocabularies. This name is derived from LOD, standing for Linked Open Data. Let's assume that the reader is somehow familiar with the latter concept, otherwise a visit to

                    .aboutDesc Data on the Web use properties (aka predicates) and classes (aka types) to describe people, places, products, events, and any kind of things whatsoever. In the data "Mary is a person, her family name is Watson, she lives is the city of San Francisco", "Person" is the class of Mary, "City" is the class of San Francisco, "family name" and "lives is" are properties used to describe a person, the latter acting also as a link between a person and a place.
                    .aboutDesc A vocabulary in #{app_name_shorcut} gathers definitions of a set of classes and properties (together simply called terms of the vocabulary), useful to describe specific types of things, or things in a given domain or industry, or things at large but for a specific usage.  Terms of vocabularies also provide the links in linked data, in the above case between a Person and a City. The definitions of terms provided by the vocabularies bring clear semantics to descriptions and links, thanks to the formal language they use (some dialect of RDF such as RDFS or OWL). In short, vocabularies provide the semantic glue enabling Data to become meaningful Data.

                    .aboutDesc Thanks to the very nature of the Web and the RDF pile of standards, vocabularies can be expressed themselves as Web data. Vocabulary terms, like people and places and all things data are about, are identified by public URIs and can be described in some RDF dialect. They can be linked inside a vocabulary and across vocabularies. Metadata can be put on vocabularies to capture information such as creator, publisher, version number, date of publication. Thanks to the recursive data model of RDF, those metadata use other vocabularies, forming a growing ecosystem.

                    .aboutDesc The oldest RDF vocabularies have been published at the turn of the century just after the first RDF specification, in 1999. Since then, thousands of them have been published and used. Some are stable recommendations, published by standard bodies like the W3C or the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative. Some are library metadata formats provided by the Library of Congress or other large national libraries (BnF, DNB, etc.). Many more are published and used by actors as diverse as large media corporations such as BBC, national administrations such as INSEE, the European Community, universities and research projects, and some are just published by individuals and put on the community table, in the tradition and spirit of the open, collaborative Web. And a growing number has been forgotten by their publishers, have broken URIs or obsolete content, although their terms can still be found in data. This is the open Web ...
                    .aboutDesc #{app_name_shorcut} provides a choice of several hundreds of such vocabularies, based on quality requirements including URI stability and availability on the Web, use of standard formats and publication best practices, quality metadata and documentation, identifiable and trustable publication body, proper versioning policy.

                    .aboutDesc The vocabulary collection is maintained by the #{app_name_shorcut} team of curators in charge of validating and inserting vocabularies in the #{app_name_shorcut} data base and assigning them a detailed review (updated on a yearly basis). Before a vocabulary is inserted, #{app_name_shorcut} team contacts the authors to make sure the vocabulary is published following the best practices and meets quality requirements of the overall #{app_name_shorcut} ecosystem. When some metadata failed to be extracted automatically (such as creators of a vocabulary), curators try to add them manually by harvesting information from the documentation or from direct communication with the publisher. Once included, an automatic script checks for vocabulary updates on a daily basis. The documentation assists any user in the task of understanding the semantics of each vocabulary term and therefore of any data using it. For instance, information about the creator and publisher is a key indication in case help or clarification is required, or to assess the stability of that artifact. About 55% of vocabularies specify at least one creator, contributor or editor. We augment this information using manually gathered information, leading to inclusion of data about the creator in over 85% of vocabularies in #{app_name_shorcut}. The database stores each version of a vocabulary over time since its first available issue. For each version, #{app_name_shorcut} stores a file backup on its server, even if the original files are no longer available from their original source. To embrace the complexity of the vocabulary ecosystem and assess the impact of a modification, one needs to know in which vocabularies and datasets a particular vocabulary term is referenced. #{app_name_shorcut} provides a unique entry point to such information.

                    .aboutDesc For every vocabulary in #{app_name_shorcut}, terms (classes, properties, datatypes, instances) are indexed and a full text search feature is offered. Compared to other existing ontology search engines, the #{app_name} search engine ranking algorithm is not only based on term popularity in datasets but take as well into account its popularity within the #{app_name_shorcut} ecosystem and most importantly assigned a different score depending on which label property a searched term matched. We distinguish four different label property categories on which a search term could match. We will take as example the search term "person": 
                      ul(style="margin-left:2em;")
                          li 
                            b local name 
                            | (URI without the namespace). Whereas a URI is not suppose to carry any meaning, it is a convention to use a compressed form of a term label to construct the local name. It becomes therefore an important artifact for term matching for which the highest score will be assigned. An example of local name matching the term "person" is 
                            span.code "http://schema.org/Person".
                          li
                            b primary labels
                            | . The highest score will also be assigned for matches on 
                            span.code rdfs:label
                            | ,

                            | properties. An example of primary label matching the term "person" is

                          li 
                            b secondary labels
                            | . We define as secondary label properties: 
                            span.code rdfs:comment
                            | , 
                            span.code dce:description
                            | ,
                            span.code dcterms:description
                            | and 
                            span.code skos:altLabel
                            | . A medium score is assigned for matches on these properties. An example of secondary label matching the term "person" is 
                            span.code dcterms:description "Examples of a Creator include a person, an organization, or a service."@en.
                          li 
                            b tertiary labels 
                            | . Finally all properties not falling in the previous categories are considered as tertiary labels for which a low score is assigned. An example of tertiary label matching the term "person" is 
                            span.code http://metadataregistry.org/uri/profile/RegAp/name "Person"@en. 

                      | As a result a term matching a value for the property 
                      span.code rdfs:label 
                      | will have a higher score than if it matches a value for the property 
                      span.code dcterms:comment
                      | . Based on the different nature of these labels, we apply different indexing tokenizers and scoring methods.
